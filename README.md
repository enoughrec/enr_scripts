enr_scripts
===========

Mac Bash Scripts used to convert media for Enough Records uploads to different sites.

Place them under ```/usr/local/bin/``` to have access via terminal

You'll need to install ffmpeg for the audio conversion: ```sudo port install ffmpeg``` on the command line should do the trick, assuming you already have macports installed, if you don't you'll need to download and install macports first.
