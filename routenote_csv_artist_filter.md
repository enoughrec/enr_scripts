i want to automate the filtering of artists from the .csv dump provided by routenote at some point

until i do here are the basic step instructions to obtain it:

* import csv

* select 2nd row

* go to data -> standard filter

* select column C and insert the name of the artist

* scroll to borrom

* insert formula =subtotal(9, O1:O<lastrow>);
